    <h1>Expectation and Evaluation</h1>
    <h3>Desired Outcomes</h3>
    <div>
        <head>Expectation</head>
        <p>The goal is to increase awareness and understanding of Indigenous cultures among both children and educators, foster a more inclusive and respectful classroom environment, and encourage a shift towards integrating Indigenous ways of knowing in early childhood education.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    <div>
        <head>Effectiveness</head>
        <p>The effectiveness of these actions will be evaluated through feedback from children, parents, and Indigenous community members. Surveys and informal discussions will be used to gather responses. Questions might include, "What new things have you learned about Indigenous cultures?" and "How do you feel about the outdoor learning sessions?"</p>
        <head>Group Process </head>
        <p> If working with a partner or a small group, a summary of group dynamics and individual contributions will be included, detailing the collaborative process and specific roles.</p>
