    <h1>Final Project: Decolonizing and Indigenizing the Early Childhood Education (ECE) Classroom</h1>
    <div>
        <h4>Description of the Group</h4>
        <p>The group in question is an Early Childhood Education (ECE) classroom consisting of a diverse group of children aged 3 to 5 years. The classroom has 15 children, with a mixture of Indigenous and non-Indigenous backgrounds. The purpose of this group is to provide foundational learning experiences, foster social development, and create an inclusive and respectful environment for all children. The educators in this group aim to prepare children for future educational success while instilling values of respect, empathy, and community.        </p>
        <h4>Reason for Choosing This Group</h4>
        <p>Early childhood is a critical period for shaping perspectives and values. As an ECE student and aspiring educator, I recognize the importance of incorporating diverse worldviews and practices in the classroom. My role in this group is as a student teacher, where I have the opportunity to observe, assist, and implement educational activities.</p>

    <h2>The Action</h2>
    <div>
        <h4>Action of Decolonization</h4>
        <head>Description</head>
        <p> The action of decolonization involves critically examining and revising the curriculum and teaching materials. This process includes removing or re-contextualizing content that perpetuates stereotypes or colonial narratives and ensuring that the materials reflect a balanced and accurate representation of Indigenous cultures and histories.</p>
        <head>Example</head>
        <p>Instead of only highlighting colonial explorers during history lessons, the curriculum could include stories and contributions of Indigenous peoples, their knowledge systems, and their resistance to colonialism.</p>
    </div>
    <h4> Action of Indigenization</h4>
    <div>
        <head>Description</head>
        <p>The action of Indigenization involves incorporating Indigenous ways of knowing and learning into daily activities and routines. This can be achieved by inviting Indigenous elders and community members to share stories, songs, and cultural practices with the children. Additionally, the classroom can integrate Indigenous pedagogies, such as learning through observation and participation, and emphasizing the connection to nature.</p>
        <head>Example</head>
        <p>Regular outdoor learning sessions where children engage with the natural environment, learn about local plants and animals, and understand the importance of land stewardship from an Indigenous perspective.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>The Plan</h4>
    <div>
        <h2>Activity Explanation</h2>
        <Head>Details</Head>
        <p>The decolonization action will involve reviewing and revising the existing curriculum to include Indigenous perspectives and histories. This will be done collaboratively with Indigenous educators and community members. The Indigenization action will include regular storytelling sessions with Indigenous elders and outdoor learning activities that connect children to the natural environment.</p>  
        <head>Location And Timing</head>
        <p>These activities will take place within the classroom and in nearby outdoor areas. Storytelling sessions will occur weekly, and outdoor learning sessions will be held twice a month, aligned with seasonal changes and Indigenous cultural practices.</p>
        <head>Involvement</head>
        <p>As a student teacher, I will facilitate the collaboration with Indigenous educators and community members, coordinate the storytelling sessions, and plan the outdoor learning activities.</p>    
    </div>
    <h4>Sensory Elements</h4>
    <div>
        <head>Symbols/Iamages</head>
        <p>The classroom will feature Indigenous artwork, symbols, and images that reflect the diverse cultures and histories of Indigenous peoples. Multimedia elements such as videos of traditional dances and music will also be included.</p>
        <head>Relation to senses</head>
        <p>These elements will engage the five senses by providing visual (artwork, images), auditory (stories, music), and tactile (artifacts, natural objects) experiences. They will connect children to Indigenous worldviews and emphasize the importance of cultural diversity and respect.</p>
